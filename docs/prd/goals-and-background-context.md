# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- **G1:** Enable transparent oversight of legislative spending by simplifying data access.
- **G2:** Provide intuitive visualizations for complex financial data from the Chamber of Deputies.
- **G3:** Automate the detection of spending anomalies and quota proximity.
- **G4:** Establish a scalable foundation for historical legislative auditing.

## Background Context
The project addresses the difficulty citizens face in monitoring the "Cota para o Exercício da Atividade Parlamentar" (CEAP). While data is public via the "Dados Abertos" API, it is often presented in formats that are non-intuitive for non-technical users. **Fiscal** bridges this gap by transforming raw JSON/CSV data into a citizen-centric dashboard with alerts, rankings, and historical comparisons.
