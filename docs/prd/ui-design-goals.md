# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A "Clean & Transparent" interface. Use a high-contrast dark mode or professional light theme with clear typography (e.g., Inter/Roboto). Avoid clutter; focus on the data.

## Core Screens and Views
1.  **Home/Search:** Hero section with search bar and featured rankings.
2.  **Deputy Dashboard:** The main view focusing on profile, charts, and suppliers.
3.  **Global Rankings (V2):** Comparison lists and state-by-state heatmaps.
4.  **Audit Center (V3):** Detailed historical reports and pattern detection logs.

## Target Platforms
- **Web Responsive:** Primarily desktop for detailed analysis, but fully functional on mobile for quick checks.
