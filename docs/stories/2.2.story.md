# Story 2.2: Spending Overview

As a citizen,  
I want to see the total amount spent by a deputy in the current year,  
so that I understand their spending volume.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC1: Create a `DeputyDashboard` page with routing (e.g., `/deputy/:id`).
- [ ] AC2: UI displays the deputy profile (photo, name, party, state).
- [ ] AC3: Display "Total Spent" in the current year.
- [ ] AC4: Display a progress bar relative to the state's (UF) monthly quota ceiling.
- [ ] AC5: Implement back navigation to the search page.

## 🛠️ Dev Notes

### UI/UX
- Use a high-end dashboard feel with KPIs (cards for total values).
- Progress bar should use professional colors (Emerald for low, Amber for mid, Rose for high usage).

### Data Access
- Fetch data from `deputies` table for profile.
- Fetch data from `expenses` table for totals (Sum `net_value`).
- Static mapping for state ceilings (CEAP ceilings).

## 📝 Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Setup `react-router-dom` in `App.tsx`.
- [ ] Task 2: Create `DeputyDashboard` component in `src/apps/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/`.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement data fetching for deputy expenses in the dashboard.
- [ ] Task 4: Add CEAP ceiling constants per state.
- [ ] Task 5: Link `DeputyCard` click to navigate to the new dashboard page.
