# Story 2.1: Search Functionality

As a citizen,  
I want to search for my deputy by name,  
so that I can see how they are spending my taxes.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC1: Create a Search landing page with a central search bar.
- [ ] AC2: Implement a search logic that filters the `deputies` table from Supabase.
- [ ] AC3: Display results as cards (Name, Party-UF, Photo).
- [ ] AC4: Clicking a card (or searching) should be the entry point for the Deputy Dashboard.

## 🛠️ Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- **Frontend**: React + Vite in `src/apps/frontend`.
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS. Follow branding guidelines in `docs/front-end-spec/branding-and-style-guide.md`.
- **Database**: Fetch from `deputies` table using Supabase Client.
- **Layout**: Follow "Home / Search Screen" specs in `docs/front-end-spec/key-screen-layouts.md`.

### Technical Details
- Use `useEffect` and `useState` for the search input and filtering.
- Implement a simple debounce for the search to avoid excessive database calls (optional but recommended).
- Ensure the layout is responsive (Mobile/Desktop) as per `docs/front-end-spec/responsiveness.md`.
