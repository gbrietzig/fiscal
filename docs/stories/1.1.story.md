# Story 1.1: Environment Setup

As a developer,  
I want to initialize the project with Vite/React and Supabase,  
so that I have a foundation to build features.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [x] AC1: Git repository initialized (already done in Phase 0).
- [x] AC2: Supabase project structure identified or local configuration prepared.
- [x] AC3: Project folder structure created according to architecture spec.
- [x] AC4: Initial `package.json` with React, Vite, and essential dependencies (Radix UI, Chart.js).

## 🛠️ Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite, Supabase, PostgreSQL. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo approach with `src/apps/frontend` and `src/functions`. [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS + Radix UI. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
- Frontend: `src/apps/frontend/`
- Functions: `src/functions/`
- Shared: `src/packages/shared/`

## 🤖 CodeRabbit Integration
> **CodeRabbit Integration**: Disabled
> CodeRabbit CLI is not enabled in `core-config.yaml`.

## 📝 Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create the directory structure: `src/apps/frontend`, `src/functions`, `src/packages/shared`.
- [x] Task 2: Initialize Vite React project in `src/apps/frontend`.
- [x] Task 3: Install core dependencies: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `radix-ui` primitives, `chart.js`.
- [x] Task 4: Create a basic `README.md` in the root explaining the workspace.
- [x] Task 5: Verify `.gitignore` covers node_modules and env files.
