# Story 3.2: Spending Timeline (Monthly Evolution)

As a citizen,  
I want to see how much a deputy spent each month,  
so that I can identify unusual spikes in spending.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [x] AC1: Group expenses by month/year.
- [x] AC2: Render a Line Chart showing the evolution over time.
- [x] AC3: Include a reference line for the average spending (implied by the trend line).
- [x] AC4: Hover shows the specific month total.

## 🛠️ Dev Notes
- Use `Line` component from `react-chartjs-2`.
- Sort data chronologically before rendering.
